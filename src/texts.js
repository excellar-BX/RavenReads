    body: "I am a raven, dark and lonely, my path – dark, gloomy and desolate. My bloodline as a raven makes me void of friends and companions. I feel desolate and abandoned. I have become a lone Wolf.  A wolf with no pack abandoned to fend for myself. To be alone, from everyone and in everything. I am a raven always alone. Emitting and exuding a phenomenal aura which makes others think and feel I am dark and dangerous. I don’t settle for less but fight for more, unlike others who are mediocre. I am starting to love the solitude that cools my nerve, the peace and quiet that makes me calm. I want the peace. I want the silence .To mute all voices and sounds, to make my world as quiet as a graveyard .To do my things quietly and secretly away from the eye of others .To confide in no one. The euphoria and joy that comes from the solitude makes me reach a climax of extraordinary excitement .My path is painful and full of thorns but my cross I carry alone , my pain I feel  and bear in silence. I am a raven dark and lonely and this is the faith which I must accept."

    body: "Creatures just like me. Unknown and unpredictable. Yet you cannot live without interacting with them. Through this interaction, you will come to know them and maybe they will not seem strange and unfamiliar any longer. Humans, some we meet and become friends, with others, remain strangers. Some make you laugh others make you cry. Some teach you lessons of life. Yet some come into your life to take and help you through a phase. Humans, man’s greatest help and support yet still man’s greatest tool of destruction. These creatures I call humans have different attributes, personalities, and temperaments attached to them. They are kind, smart, innovative, compassionate, and above all evil and manipulative. They are well versed in manipulating one another for their personal and selfish gains. They even become your friends with no ulterior motive than to hurt you. Some steal your smile and make you cry while some make you laugh when you did not even want to smile. Some tell you sudden goodbyes when they promised to stay with you till forever. We grow to love some and dislike others. But with the help of these creatures you can achieve your goals and through their assistance you will discover your strengths and weaknesses. Yet these creatures cannot be trusted. They promise to stay till forever and they always break that promise and this has made me question myself if maybe the forever they promised to give us was the memories they shared with us and not they themselves. Still these creatures are the most dangerous and unknown, and the unknown was always something to be feared and cautious of. "

    body: "I exist in this world. A cruel world that only repatriates from me. The world I exist in is only after mundane things and not each other’s welfare. This world doesn’t accept me. The world in which I try so much to be accepted, to be loved and to be respected. I have tried so much to be accepted, to fit in, but no matter how hard I try there is always this line that draws me apart from the world. I just want to be like them… the people from my world. To feel like one of them.",

    body: "It is okay to make mistakes. It is okay if there are errors. It is okay to fall. It is okay if it does not work and turn out the best. It is okay to cry. But you know what is not? It is not okay to waste away over little errors. It is not okay to be eaten up by your own guilt. It is not okay to be satisfied and complacent about being stuck in one point. It is not okay to be mediocre and settle for less. It is not okay to fall and continue to stay at the same point. Instead you should get up and strive to be better so you do not fall in the same way at the same spot over and over again. It is not okay for you to be aware of your flaws and errors and do nothing about them. It is not okay to push blame on others when you are the one responsible for the errors. It is not okay for you to hold grudges. Instead let loving your self be enough reason to forgive and move on. Truly, I promise, there will be events in our lives that will burn down our ideals of the perfect life, our dreams, our desires, our goals, our resolutions and plans. There will be events in our life that will make us feel like giving up. There will be events in our lives that will make us question ourselves, events that will make us doubt ourselves and our faith, events that will make us feel unworthy and incapable. But we should not let these events stop us from doing our bests. We should not let these events determine who we are to become. These events should not stop us from giving our best and achieving what we truly want and desire. Instead let us stay strong and pray. I know truly that it is not going to be easy in anyway and that I assure you. Still we should keep trying and pushing forward. I want you to know that it is okay if it is not okay because it will be okay even if it is not okay now because it has to be okay.",
